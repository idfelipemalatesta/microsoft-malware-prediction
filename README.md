# Microsoft Malware Prediction

## About the repository
This project is a kaggle community competition [Microsoft Malware Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/overview). Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware.

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed label.
